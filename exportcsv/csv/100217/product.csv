155846,"Hemarate FA 10 Tablets","Iron + Folic acid + B6 + B12 (Hemarate FA) is a round, pink-colored, biconvex tablet bisected on one side and plain on the other side.   This product is specially formulated to meet the highly increased demands of pregnant women for iron, folic acid, vitamins B6 and B12 – nutrients necessary for healthy blood to prevent anemia and to prevent neural tube defects (NTDs). Studies show that anemia is highly prevalent during pregnancy.  Aside from iron deficiency, pregnant women are also prone to folate, vitamin B6 and B12 deficiency which could lead to NTDs and hyperhomocysteinemia. The combination of folate, vitamin B6 and B12 in this product may help lower plasma homocysteine. Recent data show that elevated plasma homocysteine is associated with common pregnancy complications (e.g., preeclampsia) and adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g., prematurity, very low birth weight). Hyperhomocysteinemia has been reported to result in NTDs and is also identified as a risk factor for atherosclerosis and thrombosis.  This product combines anti-anemia and antihomocysteine nutrients:    Iron – essential in the formulation of blood, transport and storage of oxygen and a cofactor required for the proper functioning of cells.     Folic acid – required for the prevention of neural tube defects (NTDs) in infants characterized by malformation of neural tube including spina bifida which can lead to a variety of physical disabilities (e.g., paralysis and hydrocephalus). Adequate folate nutrition offers protection against complications of pregnancy, including premature detachment of the placenta, hemorrhage, low birth weight and fetal malformation. Folate deficiency is a major concern during pregnancy because during this period, there is a notable decrease in the efficiency of folate absorption and an increase in the rate of urinary folate excretion.    Vitamins B6 and B12 – help in the synthesis of hemoglobin and formation of red blood cells. These nutrients also facilitate energy metabolism and may help relieve anorexia, muscle weakness, nausea and vomiting.    Folic acid, vitamin B6 and B12 – synergistically facilitate homocysteine metabolism to prevent hyperhomocysteinemia ","One purchase of this product contains 10 tablets.

It is good for athletes and helps to protect the liver by aiding in the removal of excess ammonia."""" Studies (Agersborg and Shaw 1962, Hicks 1964, Gaby 1982) show this combination provides substantial benefit for the prevention of fatigue. Aspartic acid also combines with other amino acids to form molecules that absorb toxins and remove them from the bloodstream, aids the function of RNA and DNA, and helps to protect the liver. Additionally, the potassium/magnesium aspartate compound increases production of a key substrate, oxaloacetate, which is involved in energy production. Lastly, the compound provides the minerals potassium and magnesium to help provide protection against cramping. L-Citrulline - L-Citrulline is an amino acid that is found plant foods such as watermelon, onions, and garlic. Citrulline helps in the removal of ammonia in the muscles and liver, and, like aspartic acid, is beneficial in alleviating fatigue. L-citrulline is a precursor for the endogenous production of l-arginine. Increased blood levels of arginine significantly boost nitric oxide (NO) content. NO acts as a potent vasodilator, relaxing the arteries, and allowing them to widen. Vasodilation is responsible for increased blood flow to tissues such as muscle fibers, which supports enhanced athletic performance and cardiovascular health. OKG - Both ornithine and alpha-ketoglutarate (OKG) provide a readily available, non-ammonia-producing source of glutamine in the body. Glutamine is depleted at high rates during exercise but cannot be replaced with regular glutamine as it produces ammonia on its own. OKG increases the amount of glutamine in the muscle and also helps prevent muscle catabolism. Colgan writes, """"Both ornithine and alpha-ketoglutarate act in the body as an ammonia scavenger."""" Beet Juice Powder - We use it to give the capsule contents some color, helping to differentiate them from similar-looking capsules such as Endurolytes. There's more to that, however, as Beet Juice Powder is rich in nitrates, which also help boost NO levels. Rice bran, which is used as a flow agent during manufacture, is a healthy nutrient-rich alternative to processing agents like stearic acid and silicon dioxide.</p> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">How to use Anti-Fatigue Caps?
